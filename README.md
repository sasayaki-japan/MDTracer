# Summary
 
MD Tracer allows you to enjoy SEGA MegaDrive (Genesis) games just like a typical emulator, but its main purpose is as a tracer that tracks the internal processing of the MegaDrive hardware and software.
 
All processing (MC68000, Z80, VDP, YM2612, PSG) is coded in VisualStadio's csharp language and .net, making it easy to understand the internal processing of the hardware.
 
The software also displays MC68000 programs in disassembled form, allowing you to stop them at any point and check the values ​​of memory, registers, etc. while stepping through the program.
 
Enjoy the amazing technology and wisdom of the engineers of the time from both the hardware and software perspectives.
 
Note: This program is not intended for playing games illegally. Its purpose is to help users understand and appreciate the ingenuity of the engineers who created this remarkable technology.
